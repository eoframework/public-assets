description: Global WAN connectivity for distributed enterprises
long_description: 'Organizations with multiple offices, data centers, and cloud resources
  need reliable connectivity between all locations. Managing separate connections,
  routing, and security policies for each site is complex and expensive. Network performance
  issues impact user experience and application availability across distributed operations.


  This solution implements Azure Virtual WAN to create a unified global network connecting
  branches, data centers, and Azure regions. It provides optimized routing through
  Microsoft''s global network, centralized security policies, and simplified management
  of all connections. The solution reduces network latency and makes it easier to
  add new locations.
