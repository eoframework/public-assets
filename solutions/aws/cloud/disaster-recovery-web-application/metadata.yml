description: Rapid business continuity with automated failover
long_description: 'Web applications are critical to business operations, but outages
  due to hardware failures, regional disruptions, or disasters can cause significant
  revenue loss and customer impact. Traditional disaster recovery solutions are expensive
  to maintain and complex to test, often requiring duplicate infrastructure that sits
  idle until needed.


  This solution implements automated disaster recovery for web applications using
  AWS services across multiple regions. It continuously replicates application data,
  maintains backup environments, and can failover automatically when primary systems
  become unavailable. The solution includes regular testing procedures to ensure recovery
  capabilities work when needed.
