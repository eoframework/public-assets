description: Automate document insights with AI-driven extraction
long_description: "Organizations process thousands of documents daily\u2014invoices,\
  \ contracts, forms, and reports\u2014requiring manual data entry and review. This\
  \ manual processing is slow, error-prone, and prevents teams from focusing on higher-value\
  \ work. Staff spend hours extracting key information, validating data accuracy,\
  \ and routing documents to the right teams.\n\nThis solution uses AWS AI services\
  \ (Textract, Comprehend) to automatically extract text, forms, and tables from documents.\
  \ It identifies key data points, classifies document types, and routes them based\
  \ on content. The system handles common business documents like invoices, purchase\
  \ orders, and contracts without custom training.\n"
