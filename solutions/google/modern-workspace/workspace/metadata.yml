description: Collaborative digital workspace for modern teams
long_description: 'Organizations need collaboration tools that work seamlessly across
  email, documents, video conferencing, and messaging. Managing separate tools from
  different vendors creates complexity and poor user experience. Data ends up scattered
  across multiple systems, making it hard to find information and collaborate effectively.


  This solution deploys Google Workspace providing integrated email, calendar, documents,
  spreadsheets, presentations, video conferencing, and team chat. Users can collaborate
  in real-time on documents, schedule meetings easily, and find information across
  all tools with unified search. The solution includes admin controls, security policies,
  and integration with existing identity systems.
