description: High-performance datacenter switching fabric
long_description: 'Data center networks must handle high-speed traffic between servers,
  storage, and external connections without becoming a bottleneck. Network complexity
  grows as organizations add virtualization, containers, and hybrid cloud connectivity.
  Managing individual switch configurations and troubleshooting network issues across
  many devices is time-consuming.


  This solution implements Dell PowerSwitch data center networking with high-speed
  switches designed for modern data center workloads. It provides low-latency connectivity
  for server-to-server traffic, supports automation for configuration management,
  and includes monitoring for identifying performance issues. The solution scales
  from small data centers to large facilities with thousands of connections.
