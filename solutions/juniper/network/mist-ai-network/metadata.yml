description: AI-driven network operations & user experiences
long_description: 'Wireless networks are critical infrastructure, but troubleshooting
  connectivity issues is time-consuming and reactive. Network teams receive vague
  complaints like "WiFi is slow" without tools to identify root causes quickly. Planning
  WiFi coverage requires specialized expertise, and changes made in one area can impact
  other locations unexpectedly.


  This solution uses Juniper Mist AI-driven wireless networking with machine learning
  to optimize performance and troubleshoot issues automatically. It provides real-time
  visibility into user experience, identifies problems before users report them, and
  recommends fixes. The solution simplifies WiFi planning with AI-powered coverage
  analysis and automates routine network operations.
