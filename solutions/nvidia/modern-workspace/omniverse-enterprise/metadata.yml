description: Real-time collaboration platform for 3D workflows
long_description: 'Design and engineering teams working on 3D content face challenges
  collaborating when using different software tools. Large 3D files are difficult
  to share, reviewing designs requires specialized software, and real-time collaboration
  is nearly impossible. Teams waste time converting files between formats and coordinating
  changes across team members.


  This solution implements NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise for real-time 3D collaboration
  and simulation. It connects different 3D tools and allows teams to work on the same
  project simultaneously regardless of the software they use. The solution provides
  physically accurate rendering, real-time visualization of changes, and centralized
  project management for 3D design workflows.
