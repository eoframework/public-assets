description: Multi-cloud infrastructure management & automation
long_description: 'Organizations using multiple cloud providers face the challenge
  of different APIs, tools, and workflows for each platform. Managing infrastructure
  requires cloud-specific expertise and creates dependencies on specific vendors.
  Deploying the same application across clouds requires building everything multiple
  times with provider-specific tools.


  This solution uses HashiCorp tools (Terraform, Consul, Vault) to create a consistent
  platform across cloud providers. It enables infrastructure-as-code that works across
  AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud with the same workflow. The solution provides unified
  service networking, secrets management, and infrastructure provisioning regardless
  of underlying cloud provider.
