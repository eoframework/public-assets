description: Enterprise infrastructure as code platform
long_description: 'Teams adopting infrastructure-as-code with Terraform need collaboration
  features, state management, and governance controls. Storing Terraform state locally
  or in basic storage risks conflicts, data loss, and security exposure of sensitive
  information. Without standardization, each team implements Terraform differently,
  making it hard to share modules and maintain consistency.


  This solution implements Terraform Enterprise to provide centralized state management,
  access controls, and policy enforcement for infrastructure-as-code. It enables team
  collaboration on Terraform code, provides approval workflows for changes, and integrates
  with VCS for version control. The solution includes module registry for sharing
  reusable code and compliance policies that automatically prevent violations.
