description: AI-driven network insights for optimized performance
long_description: 'Network teams troubleshoot issues reactively, often discovering
  problems only after users complain. Identifying the root cause requires analyzing
  data from multiple network devices, correlating events, and understanding traffic
  patterns. Without visibility into network behavior, teams struggle to prevent issues
  or optimize performance.


  This solution uses Cisco AI-powered analytics to monitor network health, predict
  problems, and provide recommendations. It collects data from network devices, identifies
  anomalies, and alerts teams before issues impact users. The solution provides insights
  into application performance, security threats, and capacity planning needs across
  the network infrastructure.
